This library has commands created for forward error correction for OreSat.


Functions:
	hamming (7,4) encoding and decoding (it's FEC and it works)
		- in the final rounds of validation and verification
		- create educational write-up

	modern-grade FEC encoding and decoding (it's better FEC and it works better)
		- decide on which code to use (probably SCCC or turbo)
		- Reed-Solomon will directly address UDP packet loss; best plan is to
			concatenate a RS code with convolution/turbo

	emergency mode encoding and decoding (for very high bit error rate)
		- calculate how much n/k to be sent in a 2 minute window
		- two emergency modes: with and without assuming UDP packets

	UDP packet header adder
		- To do. Should be simple.

	Various functions for testing FEC protocols.
		- Made: function for altering bits ever n bytes
		- To do: randomized bit error function


(README will be made better in due time.)
