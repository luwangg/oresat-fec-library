This library has commands created for forward error correction for OreSat.

Currently, everything is written as a stream input/output.

Still need to optomize.


Functions:
	hamming (7,4) encoding and decoding (it's FEC and it works)
		- in validation and verification
		- create educational write-up

	modern-grade FEC encoding and decoding (it's better FEC and it works better)
		- decide on which code to concatenate with (probably LDPC)
		- Reed-solomon function currently not working.

	emergency mode encoding and decoding (for very high bit error rate)
		- calculate how much n/k to be sent in a 2 minute window
		- two emergency modes: with and without assuming UDP packets

	UDP packet header adder
		- Basic UDP packet adder, for one packet and for a stream, created.
		
	Various functions for testing FEC protocols.
		- Made: function for altering bits ever n bytes; random bit error simulator, 
			UDP decoder with packet loss simulator


(README will be made better in due time.)
